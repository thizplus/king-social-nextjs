## Build Process Info
- **Next.js Version:** 15.3.3
- **Environment:** .env detected
- **Compilation Time:** 11.0s (if successful)
- **Build Step:** Linting and checking validity of types

## Recommendations
1. Remove all unused imports and variables
2. Replace `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image />` component
3. Replace `any` types with specific TypeScript types
4. Fix empty interfaces or remove them if not needed
5. Add missing dependencies to React hooks
6. Use `const` instead of `let` for variables that don't change

## Next Steps
Fix these errors and warnings to ensure a successful production build.
